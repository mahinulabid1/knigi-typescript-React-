                            <strong>Exchanges and Refunds</strong> <br/> <br/>
                            We are unable to exchange or refund items that have been delivered. If you have not received
                            your items or received the wrong item, please contact us. Refunds will be issued to your original

                            <strong>Shipping</strong> <br/> <br/>
                            If the customer provides inaccurate or incomplete information that causes the package to be delayed
                            or returned to the fulfillment destination the customer accepts this as a consequence of his or her
                            own actions. Items can be resent to the customer for an additional S&H fee equal to the original
                            such fees charged. For more information regarding shipping please see our FAQ. <br/> <br/>

                            International orders may be subject to import duties and taxes levied by the destination country’s
                            government. Any additional fees including but not limited to duties and taxes are not covered by
                            the shipping fee charged when your order is placed. Any such additional charges must be paid by
                            the recipient/customer.

                            Due to the customs process, delivery times are estimates and may take longer than stated.
                            In some cases, packages may be held in customs until any additional fees are paid.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Customs policies vary widely from country to country. Please contact your local customs
                            office regarding these policies including duties and taxes. <br/> <br/>
